# Human-Movement-Prediction
## Human Movement Prediction from Time Series Data

Classification of human activity (downstairs=1, jogging=2, sit-
ting=3, standing=4, upstairs=5, walking=6) from movement signals measured with three
sensors simultaneously. The dataset contains time series of training and
testing data (trX and tstX), and their corresponding labels (trY and tstY). The length of
each time series is 150 units. The training set consists of 3000 samples, and the test set
consists of 600 samples.
